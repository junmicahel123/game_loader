- This game is a game boy inspired game, where it contains games, but in this case it only contains Tetris , 2048 and a music video edit for now.
  
‼️‼️➡️➡️➡️➡️➡️PS: the program has a .EXE file for it.It is located in the folder "dist". I used pyinstaller function in terminal. Although the program is not yet working beacuse it was not made for that 
environtment. I still added it to commit for review ⬅️⬅️⬅️⬅️⬅️‼️‼️

👾👾👾The main_loader_.py was made by the creator to cater the 3 unique files into a one program showing the capabilities of OOP 👾👾👾
